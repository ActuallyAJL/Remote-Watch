## User 1 : Stephen Bluette
As a frequent traveler,
I want to watch my personal movie collection on the go,
so that I don't have to pay a dozen different streaming subscriptions.

Given that I want to watch Boss Baby,
and I am not at home,
and I did not bring Boss Baby with me,
and I have Boss Baby on a remote server at home,
then I can stream it from this application.

## User 2: Amelia Eagerne
As a security-conscious collector,
I want to make sure only approved users are viewing my collection,
so that I dont have to worry about my collection's security.

Given that I attempts to log in to my collection,
and they have not logged in before,
then they will be asked to sign in or register using and email address.

## User 3: Conrad Hamilton
As someone who loves Romantic Comedies,
I want to watch only movies with a love story,
so that I dont have to waste my time scrolling through a big list.

Given that I want to watch a specific genre,
then I can select a genre in the navbar,
and view only movies that fit that genre.

## User 4: Leopold Angleplick
As a sophisticated cinophile,
I want to tell everyone what's wrong with their favorite movie,
so that I can educate the plebs and improve the world of Kino.

Given that I'd like to share my opinion about a movie
and I've clicked to view details of the movie,
when I click to add a review,
then I can rate a movie 1-5 stars, favorite it, and write a review,
and it will be stored for me to view again later.
